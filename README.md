# Chronoamp_integration

A simple script for integrating multiple chronoamperograms. 
Data is divided into time and current columns, then the script selects the sections that correspond only to the reduction. 
Data corresponding to the OCP rest prior to the potential step is removed
All reduction transients are the integrated and the total integral is calculated as the sum of all steps
